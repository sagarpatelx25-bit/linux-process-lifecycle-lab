The execution of a program in an operating system involves understanding process creation, memory segment allocation, execution state transitions, and kernel termination feedback. This document provides a practical, step-by-step demonstration of each phase, mapping directly to **Lecture 2 (A Process Layout & OS Loading)** and **Lab 3 (Investigating Process Lifecycles)**.

### Memory Process Layout
When a process is created, the OS organizes memory into different sections:

![Memory Process Layout](assets/screenshots/raw/06_memory_layout.png)

* **Code/Text Segment**: Executable machine instructions (`R-X`).
* **Data Segment**: Initialized global and static variables.
* **BSS Segment**: Uninitialized global variables, zeroed by the kernel.
* **Heap**: Dynamic memory (`malloc`/`free`) growing upwards.
* **Stack**: Local variables, stack frames, and return pointers growing downwards.

## Step-by-Step Lab Tasks

### Task 1: The Long-Running Process

* **Objective**: In enterprise servers, processes run for days or months. We must know how to run a process in the background using `&` and monitor it while it is active using `ps aux`.
* **Command**: `cat task1_alive.c then gcc task1_alive.c -o task1 then ./task1 & then ps aux | grep task1`
* **Terminal Screenshot**:

![Task 1 - Long-Running Process](assets/screenshots/raw/01_task1_alive.png)

* **Observation**: The `&` operator executes `./task1` in the background, freeing the terminal shell immediately with job ID `[1]` and PID `12345`. The `ps aux` command confirms the process is active in state `S` (**Interruptible Sleep**), paused during its `sleep(1)` loop without consuming unnecessary CPU cycles.

---

### Task 2: Process Identity (PID and PPID)

* **Objective**: Every process in Linux has a unique Process ID (`PID`). The process that created it is the Parent Process ID (`PPID`), usually your terminal shell. Query these using `getpid()` and `getppid()`, and verify them via `ps -p <PID> -o pid,ppid,cmd`.
* **Command**: `cat task2_identity.c then gcc task2_identity.c -o task2 then ./task2 & then ps -p 12345 -o pid,ppid,cmd`
* **Terminal Screenshot**:

![Task 2 - Process Identity](assets/screenshots/raw/02_task2_identity.png)

* **Observation**: The program queries the Linux kernel and prints its unique `PID (12345)` and parent `PPID (8901)`. The OS `ps` command validates that the PPID `8901` belongs directly to the interactive terminal shell that spawned the process.

---

### Task 3: Exit Codes and OS Feedback ($?)

* **Objective**: When a program finishes, it returns an integer to the OS. `0` means "Success", and any non-zero number (like `1`) means "Error/Failure". The shell stores this in `$?`.
* **Command**: `cat task3_exit.c then gcc task3_exit.c -o task3 then ./task3 then echo $?`
* **Terminal Screenshot**:

![Task 3 - Exit Codes and OS Feedback](assets/screenshots/raw/03_task3_exit.png)

* **Observation**: When given a positive input (`5`), the program returns `0`, and `echo $?` outputs `0` (**Success**). When given a negative input (`-5`), the program returns `1`, and `echo $?` outputs `1` (**Failure**), proving that Unix processes communicate execution status directly to the calling shell.

---

### Task 4: Standard I/O Streams

* **Objective**: The OS provides standard input (`stdin`, fd 0) and standard output (`stdout`, fd 1) streams. `scanf()` reads from `stdin`, and `printf()` writes to `stdout`.
* **Command**: `cat task4_input.c then gcc task4_input.c -o task4 then ./task4`
* **Terminal Screenshot**:

![Task 4 - Standard I/O Streams](assets/screenshots/raw/04_task4_input.png)

* **Observation**: The operating system connects the keyboard stream to `stdin`, which is read by `scanf()`, and redirects formatted text from `printf()` to `stdout` on the terminal screen.

---

### Task 5: Conditional Execution and Termination

* **Objective**: Programs often branch based on user input. The OS tracks the final exit code to determine if the script or automation pipeline should continue or halt.
* **Command**: `cat task5_control.c then gcc task5_control.c -o task5 then ./task5 then echo $?`
* **Terminal Screenshot**:

![Task 5 - Conditional Execution and Termination](assets/screenshots/raw/05_task5_control.png)

* **Observation**: Choosing `1` causes the process to continue, simulate workload (`sleep(5)`), and return exit code `0` (`Success`). Choosing `0` causes the process to immediately abort and return exit code `1` (`Failure`). Each independent run receives a newly allocated PID from the kernel (`12400` vs `12405`), illustrating process creation and destruction.
